# note-taking-app-using-express.js

When opening the Note Taker, I'm presented with a landing page containing a link to the notes page. Clicking this link leads to a page where existing notes are listed on the left, with fields available on the right to input a new note's title and text. After entering the new note details, a Save icon appears in the navigation, allowing the note to be saved and displayed alongside existing ones. Clicking on an existing note in the list shows its content on the right. Additionally, clicking the Write icon enables the creation of a new note.
